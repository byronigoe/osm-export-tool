# Contributing to the Export Tool

## Welcome

:+1::tada: First off, I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help improve the Export Tool! :tada::+1:
We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels and we are committed to making sure your participation is inclusive, enjoyable and rewarding. If you have never contributed to an open source project before, we are a good place to start and will make sure you are supported every step of the way. If you have **any** questions, please ask!


There are many ways to contribute to the Export Tool Project:

## Report bugs and suggest improvements:

The [issue queue](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool/issues) is the best way to get started. There are issue templates for BUGs and FEATURES that you can use, or you can create your own. Once you have submitted an issue, it will be assigned one label out of the following [label categories](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool/labels). If you are wondering where to start, you can filter by GoodFirstIssue label.


## Testing

Test a bug fix or new feature. Once an issue has been addressed and Pull Request (PR) change deployed to the [Export Tool Staging site](https://export-staging.hotosm.org/en/v3/), you will be able to view and test the change on the staging site. A PR would then be made from develop to master branch, which would require two reviews. If you notice any issues while testing, please comment on the PR directly.


## Code contributions

Create pull requests (PRs) for changes that you think are needed. We would really appreciate your help!
